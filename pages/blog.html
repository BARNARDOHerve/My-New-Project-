                <img src="../assets/soft eng image.png" alt="software engineering background">
                <p>Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs and designing, constructing, and testing end-user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software programming languages. It is the application of engineering
                    principles to software development.</p>
                <p>A software engineer develops or designs new applications with the software needs of end-users in mind. Software engineering may also involve the process of analyzing existing software, and modifying it to meet current application needs.</p>
                <p>For example, in modern consumer electronics, devices in direct competition often have similar hardware and processing power, but the user experience will vary greatly depending on the software being used.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-article-con">
                <p>A software engineer may then be working on a set of goals according to the needs of the consumer and by proxy, the need for the company to compete with others to offer the best user experience.</p>
                <p>In contrast to simple programming, software engineering is used for larger and more complex software systems, which are used as critical systems for businesses and organizations.</p>
